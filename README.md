Unity Bootstrap




Objective
This is the Unity bootstrap. The goal is to create a project demonstrating your ability to use the Unity Game Engine. Once you’ve completed your project, you will then record a video discussing your program in a way that highlights your teaching ability.

Project Ideas and Requirements
Clone Bootstrap Repository from: https://github.com/emmanuelreyes28/UnityBootstrap

Project Setup:
Open up the “Bootstrap” scene
Drag in the “Project1Starter” prefab into the scene. This contains:
2 platforms: one start (light blue), one end (red)
A game reset area: when the player falls and reaches the trigger point, the player will go back to spawn
Canvas with Timer Text: This shows how long it takes to get from starting platform to ending platform
From your prefab folder, drag in the First Person Character. Make sure to place them on the starting platform.
Also deactivate the main camera not under the character (otherwise it will conflict with the display)


Creating the Level:
Move around the starting and ending platforms to your desired position.
Use the Platform prefab as that should contain the valid tag and components for the level
Add obstacles

Include at least three of the following:
Add new materials/textures to the platforms
Add different lighting to some of the platforms
Include interactive game objects
Change the transform to add challenges to the level
Look for assets to give your level a personal touch

You are not required to write any code for this bootstrap but feel free to do so if you know how to do so.
Video Requirements
Must Include:
Project Demo
Discuss important parts of the game as concisely an appropriately as you can based on your audience
Speak as clearly as you can, and limit background noise where possible

Consider:
Average Length: 2-5 minutes
Average Student Grade: 8-10th grade

Extras:
Think of your audience as students and consider some of the things they already know.
Highlight certain parts of the project as the main “teaching” areas. Although you made a Mario style platformer, you could choose to teach the movement and physics in the game.
Feel free to edit the video in any way you like. This is not required, but it does show us another skill if video editing is something you’re interested in.
Use any other tools to display visuals or other aides that can help your audience learn more about this project and the topics.
You may assume your students have Unity installed for the purpose of this video.
Enthusiasm and passion helps build interest for students, so don’t forget to have fun!
